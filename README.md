## Description

This project redefines vulnerability scanning by combining advanced detection, instant remediation, interactive visualization, AI-powered context analysis, and gamified team collaboration. It addresses the shortcomings of traditional OWASP scanners and introduces innovative features for education, real-time feedback, and community engagement.

---

## Existing Solutions Gap

- **Focus only on detection:** Most OWASP scanners identify vulnerabilities but provide little beyond detection.
- **Lack educational components:** Users are left to interpret findings without guidance or learning resources.
- **No collaboration features:** Teams cannot collaborate or compete in real time.
- **Poor visualization:** Reports and data are not presented in interactive or intuitive ways.

---

## Your Potential Novelty

### Live Remediation Sandbox

- **In-browser code fixing with instant rescan**
- **Implementation:** Monaco Editor + WebAssembly security checks

### Attack Path Visualization

- **Interactive graph showing vulnerability relationships**
- **Implementation:** D3.js force-directed graphs

### AI-Powered Context Analysis

- **LLM-based vulnerability explanation**
- **Implementation:** Open router API

### Team Warfare Mode

- **Compete to find/fix vulnerabilities fastest**
- **Implementation:** Real-time leaderboards

---

## Features

- **OWASP Top 10 Scanning**  
  Detects the most critical web vulnerabilities using both static and dynamic analysis.

- **Live Remediation Sandbox**  
  Edit vulnerable code directly in-browser with Monaco Editor and instantly re-scan to verify fixes.

- **AI-Powered Explanations**  
  Get plain-English vulnerability explanations and tailored fix suggestions from an integrated AI assistant.

- **Attack Path Visualization**  
  Interactive graph shows how vulnerabilities can be chained together for real-world exploits.

- **Team Collaboration**  
  Assign vulnerabilities, comment in real time, and manage security tasks as a team.

- **False Positive Management**  
  Mark and track false positives for accurate reporting and continuous learning.

- **Custom Payload Testing**  
  Advanced users can supply their own attack payloads to test for edge-case vulnerabilities.

- **Scan History & Reporting**  
  All scans and actions are securely stored for future reference and compliance.

- **Export Reports as PDF**  
  Download well-formatted PDF reports of your scan results for sharing or documentation.

## Setup and Run

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (LTS version recommended) ‚Äì [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd vulnalyze

2. **Install dependencies:**
npm install



### Running the Project

- **Start the development server:**
npm run dev


- **Note:** The project may **not run on `localhost:3000`** by default.  
  - For Next.js, it often runs on `localhost:3000` by default, but check your terminal output for the actual address.
  - For Vite or other frameworks, the port may differ and will be displayed in your terminal after running `npm run dev`.

---

## Usage

1. **Start the development server with:**
npm run dev


2. **Or access the live deployed version here:**  
[https://vulnalyze.netlify.app](https://vulnalyze.netlify.app)
3. **Upload or paste code, explore vulnerabilities, and use the live remediation sandbox.**
4. **Compete with teammates in Team Warfare Mode for added fun!**

--tip:
Replace <your-repository-url> with the actual URL of your Vulnalyze repository.
Check your terminal output after running npm run dev to see the exact local address where your app is running.
